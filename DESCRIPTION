Description: This package is to make community assembly inferences and/or perform simulations experiments. Here, one can simulate
    community assembly models such as neutral, habitat filtering, and competitive exclusion. Once can then summarize the simulated data
    of these models into summary statistics and use those summary statistics to perform model selection using ABC and randomForest.
    One can also perform parameter estimation for the strength of filtering or competition, should those models be selected. Model adequacy
    and posterior predictive simulations can be performed. Empirical data can also be imported and one can calculate summary statistics of
    their own data.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.2)
